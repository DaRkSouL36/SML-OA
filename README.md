## 📘 PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE LIMITATIONS OF STATIC AND HEURISTIC-BASED OFFLOADING STRATEGIES BY INTRODUCING A **STATISTICALLY GROUNDED DECISION PIPELINE**.

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE:
- REALISTIC IOT WORKLOAD SYNTHESIS USING PROBABILISTIC DISTRIBUTIONS  
- EXECUTION TIME ESTIMATION USING LIGHTWEIGHT REGRESSION  
- A FORMALLY DEFINED **COMPOSITE OFFLOADING SCORE (COS)**  
- IQR-BASED STATISTICAL TIERING FOR IOT / EDGE / CLOUD  
- ANOMALY AND VOLATILITY DETECTION USING SKEWNESS & KURTOSIS  
- STRESS-AWARE FALLBACK MECHANISMS FOR QUEUE SATURATION  

---

## 💬 FEATURES

- DISTRIBUTION-AWARE TASK MODELING (LOGNORMAL + GAMMA)
- EXECUTION TIME PREDICTION WITH LOW LATENCY OVERHEAD
- COMPOSITE OFFLOADING SCORE WITH CONVEX WEIGHT CONSTRAINTS
- SLIDING-WINDOW STATISTICAL DECISION MAKING
- OUTLIER AND VOLATILITY DETECTION
- QUEUE-AWARE FALLBACK AND FAIL-SAFE LOGIC
- FULL DECISION TRACEABILITY VIA STRUCTURED LOGGING

## ⚙️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

<p align="center">
  <img src="VISUALS\COMPONENTS OF OM.png" width="900"/>
</p>

THE ARCHITECTURE IS DIVIDED INTO:
- **LOCAL DOMAIN**: TASK INSPECTION, FEATURE EXTRACTION, COS COMPUTATION  
- **COORDINATION DOMAIN**: STATISTICAL TIERING AND GLOBAL DECISION LOGIC  
- **OSMOTIC MANAGERS (OMs)**: COORDINATE FLOW ACROSS TIERS AND HANDLE STRESS CONDITIONS  

TASKS ARE ROUTED BASED ON DISTRIBUTION-AWARE STATISTICS RATHER THAN FIXED THRESHOLDS.

---

## 📊 OPERATOR DASHBOARD & MONITORING

<p align="center">
  <img src="VISUALS\OPERATOR DASHBOARD.png" width="900"/>
</p>

THE OPERATOR DASHBOARD PROVIDES:
- REAL-TIME VISIBILITY INTO TASK FLOW  
- QUEUE OCCUPANCY (IOT / EDGE / CLOUD)  
- SYSTEM STRESS FLAGS  
- ANOMALY INDICATORS  
- LOGGING AND SANDBOXING SUPPORT FOR DECISION AUDITABILITY  

---

## 🌐 OSMOTIC COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM

<p align="center">
  <img src="VISUALS\OSMOTIC ECOSYSTEM.png" width="900"/>
</p>

THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED WITHIN A MULTI-TIER **OSMOTIC COMPUTING PARADIGM**, WHERE:
- COMPUTATION FLOWS DYNAMICALLY BETWEEN TIERS  
- DECISIONS ARE CONTEXT-AWARE AND STATISTICALLY INFORMED  
- GLOBAL STABILITY IS MAINTAINED THROUGH LOCAL ADAPTATION  

---

## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

1. **TASK GENERATION**
   - SYNTHETIC IOT TASKS GENERATED USING LOGNORMAL AND GAMMA DISTRIBUTIONS.

2. **EXECUTION TIME PREDICTION**
   - LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL ESTIMATES EXECUTION LATENCY (R² ≈ 0.97).

3. **COS COMPUTATION**
   - NORMALIZED TASK FEATURES ARE COMBINED USING WEIGHTED COS FORMULATION.

4. **STATISTICAL TIERING**
   - IQR-BASED THRESHOLDS ASSIGN TASKS TO IOT, EDGE, OR CLOUD.

5. **ANOMALY & STRESS HANDLING**
   - SKEWNESS, KURTOSIS, AND QUEUE STATES TRIGGER FALLBACK DECISIONS.

6. **LOGGING & VISUALIZATION**
   - ALL DECISIONS ARE LOGGED FOR POST-HOC ANALYSIS AND VISUAL DIAGNOSTICS.

## 🔄 OFFLOADING DECISION FLOW (SML-OA PIPELINE)

<p align="center">
  <img src="VISUALS\FLOWCHART.png" width="900"/>
</p>

THE FLOWCHART ILLUSTRATES THE END-TO-END CONTROL FLOW OF THE SML-OA PIPELINE:

- TASKS ARRIVE FROM IOT DEVICES INTO A SLIDING-WINDOW TASK QUEUE  
- FEATURES (TASK SIZE, CPU DEMAND) ARE EXTRACTED  
- EXECUTION TIME IS PREDICTED USING A LIGHTWEIGHT REGRESSION MODEL  
- FEATURES ARE NORMALIZED AND COMBINED INTO A COMPOSITE OFFLOADING SCORE (COS)  
- STATISTICAL METRICS (Q1, Q3, IQR, SKEWNESS, KURTOSIS) ARE COMPUTED  
- ANOMALIES ARE ISOLATED AND SANDBOXED WHEN REQUIRED  
- NORMAL TASKS FOLLOW STATISTICAL TIERING (IOT / EDGE / CLOUD)  
- SYSTEM STRESS TRIGGERS A FALLBACK ENGINE TO PRESERVE QOS  

THIS PIPELINE ENSURES DISTRIBUTION-AWARE, INTERPRETABLE, AND STRESS-RESILIENT TASK OFFLOADING.

## 🏁 USAGE

1. RUN THE NOTEBOOKS SEQUENTIALLY TO:
   - GENERATE TASK DATA  
   - TRAIN EXECUTION TIME MODEL  
   - SIMULATE OFFLOADING DECISIONS  

2. ANALYZE:
   - COS DISTRIBUTIONS  
   - TIER ASSIGNMENTS  
   - ANOMALY FLAGS  
   - QUEUE EVOLUTION  

3. USE GENERATED LOGS FOR:
   - BOX PLOTS  
   - HEATMAPS  
   - SKEWNESS & KURTOSIS ANALYSIS  

---

## 📈 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

- EXECUTION TIME PREDICTION ACHIEVES **R² ≈ 0.969** WITH LOW ERROR.
- STATISTICAL TIERING PROVIDES STABLE DECISIONS UNDER SKEWED WORKLOADS.
- NO RELIANCE ON STATIC THRESHOLDS OR HARD-CODED RULES.
- FALLBACK LOGIC PREVENTS EDGE SATURATION UNDER STRESS.
- THE FRAMEWORK DEMONSTRATES STRONG INTERPRETABILITY, ROBUSTNESS, AND SCALABILITY.

---

## 🚀 FUTURE WORK

- REINFORCEMENT LEARNING–BASED ADAPTIVE COS WEIGHTING  
- ONLINE LEARNING FOR NON-STATIONARY WORKLOADS  
- REAL-TIME STREAMING DASHBOARDS  
- DEPLOYMENT IN REAL IOT–EDGE TESTBEDS
